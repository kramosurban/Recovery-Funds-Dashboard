<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<center>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2023-01-31
</center>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Who created this dashboard?</strong> This dashboard was
created by the Urban Institute in partnership with the Chicago Community
Trust. This work is supported by the Kresge Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Why was this dashboard created, and how can it be
used?</strong> This dashboard was created to track funds flowing through
Chicago, Cook County, and Illinois governments for COVID-19 response,
and to capture economic recovery programs relevant to the Chicago
Community Trust’s institutional priority areas. The dashboard can be
used by community stakeholders, policy researchers, and those interested
in learning more about COVID-19 recovery to learn about funding
allocations and spending priorities across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the information in this dashboard come
from?</strong> Allocation and expenditure data are compiled from federal
agency reports and public spending plans and budget reports from our
three geographies of focus: Chicago, Cook County, and Illinois. For each
program, the individual data source and source links are listed in the
programs table.</p>
<p><strong>What federal recovery dollars are reflected in this
dashboard?</strong> This dashboard reflects the subset of funds from the
American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act (CARES), and the Coronavirus Response and Relief
Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) provided directly to Chicago,
Cook County, and Illinois that align with the priority policy areas
identified by the Chicago Community Trust. In the case of Chicago, the
dashboard also reflects a local General Obligation Bond which the city
paired with ARPA State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) in its
Recovery Plan.</p>
<p><strong>What federal recovery dollars are not reflected in this
dashboard?</strong> This dashboard does not include funds that flow
directly from the federal government to public housing authorities,
school districts or educational institutions, individuals and
households, and nongovernmental organizations including nonprofit
organizations and private sector businesses. The dashboard also does not
include funds used for revenue replacement and operations. Additionally,
some funds under SLFRF may fall under categories that do not reflect the
Chicago Community Trust’s core priority policy areas of focus and are
not captured in the dashboard. Finally, the current version of the
dashboard does not include funds allocated to jurisdictions through the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which will be included in
future dashboard updates.</p>
<p><strong>How did you select which funding programs to
include?</strong> Selected programs reflect a subset of major federal
economic recovery funds flowing directly to states, counties, and
localities. For ARPA SLFRF, the Chicago Community Trust reviewed funding
allocations across jurisdictions and selected programs that align with
their institutional priority policy areas in supporting economic
recovery: community investment, community safety, household investment,
housing, and workforce development. We also include total amounts of
CARES state and local discretionary funding for which we do not have
more specific information on how the funds were spent. While it’s
possible that some of these funds were used for purposes that fall
outside of our identified policy areas, we chose to err on the side of
inclusion until we can identify more precise information. The dashboard
does not include the full list of funding allocations across Chicago,
Cook County, and Illinois, which can be found in each jurisdictions’
respective recovery plans.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between ARPA and ARPA State and Local
Fiscal Recovery Funds?</strong> The State and Local Fiscal Recovery
Funds (SLFRF) program is an allocation within ARPA of $350 billion to
state, local, and tribal governments across the country. While some ARPA
funds can only be used for specific purposes, such as emergency housing
or small business assistance, SLFRF are flexible funds that state,
county, and local governments can use for a wider range of programs to
aid response to and recovery from COVID-19. A full list of applicable
uses of SLFRF funds can be found on the U.S. Department of the Treasury
website, and more information on each funding source in the dashboard
can be found in the glossary.</p>
<p><strong>How did you select topics and subtopics to categorize
funds?</strong> The dashboard categorizes funding allocations across
five topics and twenty subtopics that map budget line items from local,
county, and state recovery plans to the Chicago Community Trust’s
priority policy areas and strategies in its work supporting inclusive
recovery. See the glossary for a definition of each topic and subtopic
included in the dashboard. The topics may change and may feature
additional categories as new information on allocations and expenditures
becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Will the dashboard feature expenditure data?</strong> The
dashboard does not currently feature expenditure data, but will be
updated with spending data for selected programs as information becomes
available. Spending information can be pulled from public state, county,
and local government expenditure reports, including legislative budget
reports and mandatory recovery plan performance reports to the U.S.
Treasury Department. Spending information for regional entities and
tribal governments that received federal funding – which are not
included in this dashboard – can be pulled in the same manner. Reporting
requirements and deadlines vary by program.</p>
<p><strong>Why are some funding amounts not exact?</strong> The ARPA
SLFRF-funded programs included in the dashboard are sourced from line
item programs as listed by local, county, and state governments in
public ARPA recovery plan reports. In some cases, these reports list
multiple programs under one broad spending category, with one budget
number for all programs—for instance, a public safety category may
include three separate programs listed under one total budget number for
all public safety initiatives, without allocations for each program. The
“amount exact?” column indicates where we have split the total program
budget evenly across multiple line items to generate an estimated
average amount per program, and where we have pulled the exact budget
number for one line item program.</p>
<p><strong>Why do program names and funding amounts not appear for all
projects in the programs chart?</strong> The programs chart shows the
subset of the total projects included in the dashboard matching the
selected policy topic, jurisdiction, and/or legislation. The size of
each project box in the chart is proportionate to the share of total
funding shown in the chart represented by each project (e.g. if a
project represents 10% of the total funding in the chart, the area of
that project box will be 10% of the total chart area). For some
combinations of policy topic, jurisdiction, and legislation, there are
many projects displayed in the chart which forces the size of some
projects with smaller funding amounts to be too small to display the
project name and allocation. To view the name and allocation for those
projects, you can either subset the project chart to a single law (ARPA,
CARES, or CRRSAA) or you can view the programs description table.</p>
<p><strong>How were the programs in the “Explore Spending for Selected
Programs” section at the bottom of the dashboard chosen?</strong> The
dashboard features selected programs for which expenditure data at the
zip code level is available. This section of the dashboard features a
map and demographic information for zip codes receiving program funds,
providing baseline information that users could apply towards their own
analyses, such as equity assessments for specific programs. We are
working to add more programs to this section as we identify more
programs with zip code-level spending data available.</p>
<p><strong>Will the dashboard be updated?</strong> Yes. The dashboard
will be updated on a continual basis as new information on fund
allocations and expenditures becomes publicly available.</p>
